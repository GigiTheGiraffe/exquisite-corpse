# Le petit chapelier

Il était une fois un petit chapelier fou qui cherchait son chat. Ne le trouvant pas, il choisit de chercher dans sa maison, une grande cabane de 3 étages faite au fond des bois. Malheureusement, après avoir cherché tout son royaume fait de bois, il ne le trouva pas. Mais comment pourrait-il le trouver?


With some help! So he called his neighbor... a Wolf.  
he explained all the situation to him and after an agreement, a steak for his help, they started the research.  
Thanks to the big black nose of the wolf they instantly understood where the cat was!  
With great surprise the smell of the Chapelier's cat was coming from ....

**##** **The fake report card**

I failed the first quarter of a class in middle school, so I made a fake report card. I did this every quarter that year. I forgot that they mail home the end-of-year cards, and my mom got it before I could intercept with my fake. She was PISSED—at the school for their error. The teacher also retired that year and had already thrown out his records, so they had to take my mother’s “proof” (the fake ones I made throughout the year) and “correct” the “mistake.” I’ve never told her the truth.
